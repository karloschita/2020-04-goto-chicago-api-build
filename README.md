Repo for 2020-04 GOTO chicago "API Build" masterclass

_I'll be posting prep material here each day in the run-up to the masterclass later this week._

### Class Prep
We'll be working on exercises and class assignments throughout the sessions. To make sure you're ready for the projects, read through the [Installing](2020-04-installing.md) document for details on how to get your workstation/laptop set up for the masterclass.

### FORK the API Starter Kit
The major assignment for this course uses the [API Starter Kit](https://github.com/api-tool-kit/api-starter-kit). Be sure to FORK that project in github and then clone yor copy of the project to your local machine to start your assignment.
