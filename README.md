Repo for 2020-04 GOTO chicago "API Build" masterclass

_I'll be posting prep material here each day in the run-up to the masterclass later this week._

### Class Prep
We'll be working on exercises and class assignments throughout the sessions. To make sure you're ready for the projects, read through the [Installing](2020-04-installing.md) document for details on how to get your workstation/laptop set up for the masterclass.
